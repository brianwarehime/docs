## Welcome

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Access tokens and retrieved from your user settings.

Specify them in your requests with the header `x-access-tokens:`

We currently have the following endpoints available:
- /api/v1/iocs - retrieve all IOC's
- /api/v1/iocs/8.8.8.8 - retrieve IOC details using the value of the IOC
- /api/v1/upload_iocs - POST new IOC's to threatnote
