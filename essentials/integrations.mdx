At Threatnote.io, we understand that for cyber threat intelligence teams, the ability to seamlessly integrate with a variety of data sources is not just a convenienceâ€”it's a necessity. Our platform is designed to empower your security operations with robust integrations that bring together the most critical threat intelligence tools in the industry: Shodan, VirusTotal, AlienVault OTX and more.

Our integrations enable you to enrich Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) directly within Threatnote.io, providing you with dynamic, actionable insights. With data from Shodan, you can uncover vulnerable systems and devices connected to the internet. VirusTotal integration allows you to analyze suspicious URLs, delivering a comprehensive view of potential threats. AlienVault OTX brings a global threat intelligence sharing platform into the fold, offering access to a vast repository of threat data. Meanwhile, Whois data enriches your threat intelligence by offering detailed information about domain ownership and history.

The seamless integration of these tools in Threatnote.io ensures that you have all the necessary information at your fingertips, enabling faster, more informed decision-making. By leveraging these integrations, your team can quickly identify, assess, and respond to cyber threats with confidence.

For those who require even more efficiency and insight, our Business Plan offers an exclusive feature: the ability to summarize JSON enrichment content into concise, easily digestible summaries with key takeaways. This powerful capability means that instead of sifting through complex JSON structures to extract critical information, you can instantly get the essence of the data, enabling faster analysis and response times.
